## Project Motivation
Using the Cross-Industry Standard Process of Data Mining (CRISP-DM), the goal was to investigate the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset in the bid to answer the follwoing questions: 

+ From the data, which country has the highest job satisfaction for developers?
+ With respect to job satisfaction, is there any difference between developers with IT-related undergraduate major and those without such?
+ On salary, are developers who claim to contribute to open source better paid than those who don't?

## File Description
As at 1st June 2020, the dataset could be accessed here: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey

## Libraries Used
+ Pandas 
+ Matplotlib
+ Seaborn

## Results of the analysis
You may the discussion on the results which was published on Medium here: [How To Make Sense of Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019](https://medium.com/@obise.jonathan/how-to-make-sense-of-stackoverflow-developer-survey-2019-4885291da106)

The analysis on the 2019 developer survey from Stack Overflow led to the following conclusions:

+ The United States has the highest job satisfaction level in the world, and 5 of top 10 countries with the highest job satisfaction level are located in Europe.
+ Developers whose undergraduate major is not IT-related have slightly better job satisfaction.
+ Developers who contribute more to the open source have the higher salary.
