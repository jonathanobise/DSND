## Results of Our Analysis
You may the discussion on the results which was published on Medium here: [How To Make Sense of Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019](https://medium.com/@obise.jonathan/how-to-make-sense-of-stackoverflow-developer-survey-2019-4885291da106)

The analysis on the 2019 developer survey from Stack Overflow led to the following conclusions:

+ The majority of developers work from the office with Denmark and Finalnd having the highest number of developers who lay such claim.
+ Most developers say they use the Windows operating system. And developers from South Africa and Pakistan lead in the percentage of developers in this category.
+ On employment, we learn that a substantial number of developers are 'employed full-time'. The highest is Norway at about 95% and the lowest is Nigeria at about 58% who fall under this category.
